2. **Album Navigation**: Click album card → navigate to `/album/:id`
3. **Album Page**: `loadAlbum()` fetches album details and tracks
4. **Playback**: Album tracks integrate with existing `usePlayerStore`

### Key Components Interaction
```
Library Page (Grid/List) 
    ↓ (click album)
Album Page 
    ↓ (play album/track)
Player Store (queue management)
    ↓ (updates UI)
NowPlayingBar + FullscreenPlayer
```

### Database Integration
- Uses existing Supabase setup
- Enhanced with album-specific tables
- Automatic relationship management
- RLS policies for user-specific data

## 🚀 Usage Guide

### For Users:
1. **Browse Albums**: Go to Library → Albums tab
2. **Switch Views**: Toggle between grid and list view
3. **Play Albums**: 
   - Hover over album card → click play button (instant play)
   - Click album card → opens album page → full album controls
4. **Track Management**: Individual track play from album page

### For Developers:
1. **Run Database Migration**: Execute `database_albums_enhancement.sql` in Supabase
2. **Album Store**: Use `useLibraryStore` for album management
3. **Navigation**: Albums automatically link to `/album/:id`
4. **Styling**: Album cards use `.album-card` CSS class
